# Understanding CPT Codes & Medical Billing Basics

New to medical billing? Here's what every attending physician needs to know about CPT codes and the billing process.

## What are CPT Codes?

Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes are five-digit numbers that describe the medical services you provide. Created by the AMA, these codes are how you get paid for your work.

**Simple Example:**
- You perform an office visit → You use code 99213
- You read an EKG → You use code 93010
- You do a cardiac catheterization → You use code 93458

## The Six Main CPT Categories

| Category | Code Range | What It Covers |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| **Evaluation & Management (E/M)** | 99000-99499 | Office visits, consults, hospital rounds |
| **Surgery** | 10000-69999 | Any surgical procedure |
| **Medicine** | 90000-99999 | Injections, echo, cardiac cath, etc. |
| **Radiology** | 70000-79999 | X-rays, CT scans, MRI |
| **Pathology/Laboratory** | 80000-89999 | Blood work, tissue samples |
| **Anesthesia** | 00100-01999 | Anesthesia services |

## Medical Billing 101

Here's the simplified process of how you get paid:

1. **You see a patient** and document what you did
2. **Your coder assigns CPT codes** based on your documentation
3. **The claim goes to insurance** with codes and diagnosis
4. **Insurance reviews and pays** (hopefully!)
5. **Patient pays** any remaining balance

## Common Modifiers You'll See

| Modifier | What It Means | When You'd Use It |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **-25** | "I did a separate E/M visit AND a procedure" | Follow-up visit where new complaint requires separate evaluation |
| **-26** | "I only interpreted, didn't perform" | Reading an echo performed by tech/another facility |
| **-TC** | "I only performed, didn't interpret" | Facility billing for echo when you bill separately for reading |
| **-59** | "These are distinct procedures" | Cath on LAD separate from cath on RCA same session |
| **-LT/-RT** | "Left side" or "Right side" | Pacemaker placement, indicating which side |

## Documentation Tips

**What You Need to Document:**
- **Chief complaint** - Why patient came in (required)
- **Medical decision making** - Your clinical reasoning (always required)
- **History and/or Exam** - At least one is required
- **Time** - If you're billing based on time spent
- **Counseling/Coordination** - If significant

**For Time-Based Billing:**
- Document total time spent
- Note counseling and care coordination
- Typical times: Level 3 = 30-44 minutes, Level 4 = 45-59 minutes

**For Procedures:**
- **Medical necessity** - Why this procedure was needed
- **What you did** - Step-by-step description
- **Findings** - What you discovered
- **Plan** - Next steps based on results

## Key Concepts for New Attendings

**Medical Necessity**: Everything must be medically necessary. Document why each service was required.

**Bundling**: Some procedures include other services. An echo includes basic measurements - you can't bill separately for those.

**Professional vs. Technical Components**: 
- Professional (reading) = Modifier -26
- Technical (performing) = Modifier -TC
- Both together = No modifier needed

**Global Periods**: Surgery includes routine follow-up care. Don't bill separately for standard post-op visits.

## Red Flags to Avoid

- **Don't upcode** - Bill what you actually did, not the highest level
- **Don't assume** - When in doubt, ask your coder or biller
- **Don't skip documentation** - "If it's not documented, it didn't happen"
- **Don't bill unbundled** - Learn what's included in each code

## How ReCODE Chat Helps

As a new attending, ReCODE Chat can:
- Explain any CPT code in detail (try `/code` + code number)
- Help verify your documentation supports the codes
- Guide you on modifiers and billing rules
- Provide examples of proper documentation

## Your First Week Checklist

1. **Meet with your biller/coder** - Understand your practice's process
2. **Learn your common codes** - Know the top 10 codes for your specialty
3. **Document thoroughly** - Better too much than too little
4. **Ask questions** - Use ReCODE Chat or your coding team
5. **Review your work** - Check denied claims to learn

Remember: Accurate coding starts with good documentation. When in doubt, document more rather than less, and never hesitate to ask for help.
